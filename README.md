# gpt-autocomplete
A Python script that uses OpenAI's GPT model to autocomplete text from the clipboard. The script simulates Ctrl + A and Ctrl + C to copy the current text, processes it with Openai GPT api to generate an autocomplete continuation, and then pastes the combined text back using Ctrl + V.
